About
=====

This is a Sphinx extension to automatically generate API pages for whole
modules. It was originally developed for the Astropy project but is now
available as a standalone package since it can be used for any other
package. The documentation can be found on
`ReadTheDocs <http://sphinx-automodapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This extension was forked from the Astropy project for use with the ProPlot project, in order to change a few hard-coded settings that could not be changed with the existing API. ProPlot documentation can also be found on `ReadTheDocs <https://proplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.

-------------

To run the tests, you can either do::

    pytest sphinx_automodapi

or if you have `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ installed::
