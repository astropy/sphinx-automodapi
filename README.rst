About
=====

This is a Sphinx extension to automatically generate API pages for whole
modules. It was originally developed for the Astropy project but is now
available as a standalone package since it can be used for any other
package. The documentation can be found on
`ReadTheDocs <http://sphinx-automodapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

*Note that packages from the Astropy project should continue to use this
extension from the astropy-helpers rather than using this standalone
package.*
