    """
    This implements an improved attrgetter for type objects (i.e. classes)
    that can handle class attributes that are implemented as properties on
    a metaclass.

    Normally `getattr` on a class with a `property` (say, "foo"), would return
    the `property` object itself.  However, if the class has a metaclass which
    *also* defines a `property` named "foo", ``getattr(cls, 'foo')`` will find
    the "foo" property on the metaclass and resolve it.  For the purposes of
    autodoc we just want to document the "foo" property defined on the class,
    not on the metaclass.

    For example::

        >>> class Meta(type):
        ...     @property
        ...     def foo(cls):
        ...         return 'foo'
        ...
        >>> class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
        ...     @property
        ...     def foo(self):
        ...         \"\"\"Docstring for MyClass.foo property.\"\"\"
        ...         return 'myfoo'
        ...
        >>> getattr(MyClass, 'foo')
        'foo'
        >>> type_object_attrgetter(MyClass, 'foo')
        <property at 0x...>
        >>> type_object_attrgetter(MyClass, 'foo').__doc__
        'Docstring for MyClass.foo property.'

    The last line of the example shows the desired behavior for the purposes
    of autodoc.
